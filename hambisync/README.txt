When updating to the new version backup your lamps.json and application.conf files, presets (if any), delete application
folder, unpack the new version into the same location, put back your customized lamps.json file into conf directory,
add your customizations from application.conf backup to the original application.conf. It's not recommended to just
overwrite it, as the latest application.conf may provide some new options you may want to adjust.
